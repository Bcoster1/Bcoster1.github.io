            <p>Gill was born in 1882 in <a href="#">Steyning</a>, Sussex.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> He was the elder brother of <a href="#">MacDonald "Max" Gill</a> (1884-1947), the well known graphic artist. In 1897 the family moved to <a href="#">Chichester</a>. He studied at Chichester Technical and Art School, and in 1900 moved to London to train as an <a href="#">architect</a> with the practice of <a href="#">W.D. Caroe</a>, specialists in ecclesiastical architecture. Frustrated with his training, he took evening classes in stonemasonry at <a href="#">Westminster Technical Institute</a> and in <a href="#">calligraphy</a> at the <a href="#">Central School of Arts and Crafts</a>, where <a href="#">Edward Johnston</a>, creator of the <a href="#">London Underground</a> <a href="#">typeface</a>, became a strong influence. In 1903 he gave up his architectural training to become a calligrapher, letter-cutter and monumental mason.</p>

				<p>At <a href="#">Ditchling</a> in <a href="#">Sussex</a>, where he lived with his wife, he started producing sculptures. His first public success was <em>Mother and Child</em> (1912). A self-described "disciple" of the <a href="#">Ceylonese</a> philosopher and art historian <a href="#">Ananda Coomaraswamy</a>, Gill was fascinated during this period by <a href="#">Indian temple sculpture</a>.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup> Along with his friend and collaborator <a href="#">Jacob Epstein</a>, he planned the construction in the Sussex countryside of a colossal, hand-carved monument in imitation of the large-scale <a href="#">Jain</a> structures at <a href="#">Gwalior Fort</a> in <a href="#">Madhya Pradesh</a>, to which he had been introduced by the <a href="#">Indiaphile</a> <a href="#">William Rothenstein</a>.<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup></p>
                <p>In 1914 he produced sculptures for the <a href="#">stations of the cross</a> in <a href="#">Westminster Cathedral</a>. In the same year he met the typographer <a href="#">Stanley Morison</a>. After the war, together with <a href="#">Hilary Pepler</a> and <a href="#">Desmond Chute</a>, Gill founded <a href="#">The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic</a> at <a href="#">, where his pupils included the young <a href="#">David Jones</a>, who soon began a relationship with Gill's daughter, Petra.</p>
                <p>Commissioned to produce a war memorial for the <a href="#">University of Leeds</a>, Gill controversially produced a frieze depicting Jesus driving the <a href="#">money-changers</a> from the temple, showing contemporary Leeds merchants as the money-changers (Gill's contention being that the "money men" were a key cause of the war taking place). This is at the Michael Sadler Building at Leeds University.</p>
                <p>In 1924 he moved to <a href="#">Capel-y-ffin</a> in Powys, where he set up a new workshop, to be followed by Jones and other disciples. In 1928 he set up a printing press and lettering workshop in <a href="#">Speen</a>. He took on a number of apprentices, including <a href="#">David Kindersley</a>, who in turn became a successful sculptor and engraver, and his nephew, <a href="#">John Skelton</a>, noted as an important letterer and sculptor. Other apprentices included Laurie Cribb, <a href="#">Donald Potter</a> and <a href="#">Walter Ritchie</a>.<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> Others in the household included Denis Tegetmeier, married to Gill's daughter Petra, and Rene Hague, married to the other daughter, Joanna.</p>
                <p>In 1928–9, Gill carved three of eight relief sculptures on the theme of winds for <a href="#">Charles Holden</a>'s headquarters for the <a href="#">London Electric Railway</a> (now <a href="#">Transport for London</a>) at <a href="#">55 Broadway</a>, <a href="#">St James's</a>. He carved a statue of the <a href="#">Virgin and Child</a> for the west door of the chapel at <a href="#">Marlborough College</a>.<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup></p>

			<p>In 1932 Gill produced a group of sculptures, <em>Prospero and Ariel</em>,<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> and others for the <a href="#">BBC</a>'s <a href="#">Broadcasting House</a> in London. He was commissioned to produce a sequence of seven bas-relief panels for the facade of The People's Palace, now the Great Hall of <a href="#">Queen Mary University of London</a>, opened in 1936. In 1937, he designed the background of the first <a href="#">George VI</a> <a href="#">definitive stamp</a> series for the Post Office,<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> and in 1938 produced <em>The Creation of Adam</em>, three bas-reliefs in stone for the <a href="#">Palace of Nations</a>, the <a href="#">League of Nations</a> building in <a href="#">Geneva</a>, Switzerland. During this period he was made a <a href="#">Royal Designer for Industry</a>, the highest British award for designers, by the <a href="#">Royal Society of Arts</a> and became a founder-member of the newly established Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry.</p>

                <p>An in-situ example of Gill's design and personal cutting of his Perpetua typeface can be found in the nave of <a href="#">Poling</a> church in West Sussex, on a wall plaque commemorating the life of <a href="#">Sir Harry Johnston</a>. The Perpetua design was followed by the <a href="#">Gill Sans</a> typeface in 1927–30, based on the sans serif lettering originally designed for the <a href="#">London Underground</a>. (Gill had collaborated with Edward Johnston in the early design of the Underground typeface, but dropped out of the project before it was completed.) In the period 1930–31 Gill designed the typeface <a href="#">Joanna</a> which he used to hand-set his book, <em>An Essay on Typography</em>.</p>

                <p>As the revelations about Gill's private life reverberated, there was a reassessment of his personal and artistic achievement. As his recent biographer sums up:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>After the initial shock, [...] as Gill's history of adulteries, incest, and experimental connection with his dog became public knowledge in the late 1980s, the consequent reassessment of his life and art left his artistic reputation strengthened. Gill emerged as one of the twentieth century's strangest and most original controversialists, a sometimes infuriating, always arresting spokesman for man's continuing need of God in an increasingly materialistic civilization, and for intellectual vigour in an age of encroaching triviality.<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup></p>

            <h2>Personal life</h2>
            <p>In 1904 he married Ethel Hester Moore (1878–1961), and in 1907 he moved with his family to "Sopers", a house in the village of <a href="#">Ditchling</a> in Sussex, which would later become the centre of an artists' community inspired by Gill.</p>
            <p>In 1913 he moved to Hopkin's Crank at Ditchling Common, two miles north of the village. In 1924 he moved to <a href="#">Capel-y-ffin</a> in Wales. Gill soon tired of Capel-y-ffin, coming to feel that it had the wrong atmosphere and was too far from London, where most of his clients were. In 1928 he moved to Pigotts at <a href="#">Speen</a> near <a href="#">High Wycombe</a> in <a href="#">Buckinghamshire</a>,<sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup></p>
            <p>A deeply religious man, largely following the <a href="#">Roman Catholic</a> faith, his beliefs and practices were by no means orthodox.<sup><a href="#">[19]</a></sup> His personal diaries describe his sexual activity in great detail including the fact that he sexually abused his own children, had an incestuous relationship with his sister and performed <a href="#">sexual acts on his dog</a>. This aspect of Gill's life was little known until publication of the 1989 biography by <a href="#">Fiona MacCarthy</a>. The 1966 biography by <a href="#">Robert Speaight</a> mentioned none of it.</p>
            <p>Gill died of lung cancer in <a href="#">Harefield Hospital</a> in <a href="#">Middlesex</a> in 1940. He was buried in Speen churchyard in the Chilterns, near Princes Risborough, the village where his last artistic community had practised. His papers and library are archived at the <a href="#">William Andrews Clark Memorial Library</a> at <a href="#">UCLA</a>.<sup><a href="#">[20]</a></sup></p>
